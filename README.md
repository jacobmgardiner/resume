This repository is a collection of a small fraction of the various projects I have worked on over the years. Note that older projects don’t reflect my current abilities; my code has improved in quality over the years as I’ve learned and implemented new practices and technologies.

Some of the projects haven’t been updated in some time and are still full of TODO's or commented out code, and have generally not been refined to the level that I would refine a professional piece of code. Although unpolished, these projects help to demonstrate my experience and proficiency with a wide range of languages and technologies, as well as my constant growth and eagerness to learn as a software developer.

Below are summaries of each program:

## 2012-2016

### Auto Typer
This Java program automates various typing tasks—The program automatically types the text in a section of the screen selected by the user. The selected section of the screen is sent to an OCR web API which returns the text which is then typed using the Robot API.

### Netflix Filtering Service
This Chrome extension attracted a substantial number of users—It allows users to filter out objectionable content from movies and TV on Netflix. It uses the captions to automatically mute the video when an offensive word is used. It also can skip and mute according to user created filters.

### Pointer Cast
An experiment built with Unity to test certain technologies—It allows the user to cast a game to the TV and uses accelerometer input from the phone to move a pointer on the screen. The user uses this pointer to fire projectiles at moving targets on the TV. The scripts were written in C# and required an understanding of transformations in a 3D space.

## 2017-2020
### Backyard Market
A platform for selling farm goods locally—This includes a mobile app written in Kotlin for Android as well as a website. Although unfinished, the existing code demonstrates a familiarity with in-demand technologies and creative problem-solving. For example, I created a location management library to overcome limitations with the Firebase Firestore database.

### CSE310 Project
A school assignment written in C++—This assignment required understanding and mastery of many algorithms and data structures including Djikstra’s algorithm and general graph theory, heaps, linked lists, queues, and etc.

### Perfect Pitch Trainer
This was a Kotlin Mobile Multiplatform (KMM) app—It used shared Kotlin code between the Android and iOS modules. Because KMM was such a new technology, it required a lot of perseverance to learn and to overcome the problems and bugs that arose.

### Purchase Bot
A Python script that automates certain purchases. 

### Reaction Time Tracker
Another Kotlin Mobile Multiplatform app—The app measures and records the user’s reaction time in order to examine correlation between reaction time and sleep quality. 

## 2021-present
### Airmouse
A mobile app and desktop app both built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose—It uses a web-socket on the desktop app to listen for accelerometer input from the mobile app which controls the desktop computer’s mouse.

### Golden Farms
Both a website and iOS app created for a business to sell its products.

### Movie Browser
A desktop app written in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose for desktop—It provides a very convenient method of browsing and searching a list of movies obtained from a server. The development process required database management skills, web scraping skills, the use of web API's, the creation of custom search algorithms, and various optimizations.

### Parser
A parser for a simple programming language created as part of a school assignment.
