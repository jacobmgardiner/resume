This repository is a collection of various projects I have worked on over the years. It represents only a fraction of the software I have built. It is important to note that the older projects do not reflect my current abilities. The improvement in code quality over the years shows my ability to quickly learn and implement new practices and technologies.

The projects are left in the state they were in when I last worked on them. This means that some projects are full of TODO's or commented out code, and have generally not been refined to the level that I would refine a professional piece of code. I believe that although unpolished, these projects demonstrate my experience and proficiency with a wide range of languages and technologies; as well as my constant, self-driven growth as a software developer.

Below are summaries of each program:

## 2012-2016

### Auto Typer
This Java program automated various typing tasks. The user would select a section of the screen containing text and the program would then automatically type the text contained in that portion of the screen. It would capture a section of the screen and then send it to an OCR web API which would then return the text. The program then typed this text using the Robot API.

### Netflix Filtering Service
A Chrome extension that attracted a substantial number of users. It would allow users to filter out objectionable content from movies and TV on Netflix. It would use the captions to automatically mute the video when an offensive word was used. It would also skip and mute according to user created filters.

### Pointer Cast
An experiment built with Unity to test certain technologies. It would allow the user to cast a game to the TV and would use accelerometer input from the phone to move a pointer on the screen. The user would use this pointer to fire projectiles at moving targets on the TV. The scripts were written in C# and required a solid understanding of transformations in a 3D space.

## 2017-2020
### Backyard Market
A platform for selling farm goods locally. It includes a mobile app written in Kotlin for Android as well as a website. Although unfinished, the existing code demonstrates a familiarity with in-demand technologies and creative problem-solving. I created a location management library to overcome limitations with the Firebase Firestore database.

### CSE310 Project
A school assignment written in C++. It exhibits an understanding and mastery of many algorithms and data structures including Djikstra’s algorithm and general graph theory, heaps, linked lists, queues, and etc.

### Perfect Pitch Trainer
This was a Kotlin Mobile Multiplatform (KMM) app. It used shared Kotlin code between the Android and iOS modules. Because KMM was such a new technology, it required ingenuity and perseverance to learn and to overcome the problems and bugs that arose.

### Purchase Bot
A Python script that would automate certain purchases. 

### Reaction Time Tracker
Another Kotlin Mobile Multiplatform app. The app measures and records the user’s reaction time in order to determine sleep quality. 

## 2021-present
### Airmouse
A mobile app and desktop app both built with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. It uses a web-socket on the desktop app to listen for accelerometer input from the mobile app which controls the desktop computer’s mouse.

### Golden Farms
Both a website and iOS app created for a business to sell its products.

### Movie Browser
A desktop app written in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose for desktop. It provides a very convenient method of browsing and searching a list of movies obtained from a server. The development process required database management skills, web scraping skills, the use of web API's, the creation of custom search algorithms, and various optimizations.

### Parser
A parser for a simple programming language created as part of a school assignment.
